                        A passionate computer science student studying at the BAU with a
                        scholarship. I have loved computers and messing with them since I
                        was a child; this lead me to choosing computer science as my major.
                        I'm mostly interested in A.I., Linux, Rust, and operating systems.

                                My love for tinkering with Linux started when I first installed
                                it back in 2016. The degree to which it can be tweaked and
                                changed has awakened my love for computing and programming. I

                            <dd>I used to play much more before but my laptop is digging its
                                grave right now. So I mostly play mobile games like Genshin Impact
                                or simple indie games like Alto's Adventure</dd>

                            <dt>Watching Anime/Reading Manga</dt>
                            <dd>
                                I used to spend a lot of time consuming Japanese
                                art/literature, and while I don't have as much time as I
                                did for that anymore, it's still one of my favorite things to
                                do. My favorite Anime are:
                                <ul type="circle">
                                    <li>Steins;Gate</li>
                                    <li>Ansatsu Kyoushitsu/Assassination Classroom</li>
                                    <li>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso/Your Lie in April</li>
                                    <li>No Game No Life</li>
                                </ul>
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Listening to Podcasts</dt>
                            <dd>
                                I only started listening to podcasts a couple of years ago,
                                but it has already become one of my favorite things to do!
                                It's a nice thing to do when you just want to close your eyes
                                and listen to something, or when doing something routinical
                                that requires hands like house chores. Some of my favorites are:
                                Trash Taste, The Wan Podcast, and Philosophize This
                            </dd>

                            <dt>Music</dt>
                            <dd>
                                I mostly listen either to Japanese music (usually but not
                                necessarily from Anime) or purely instrumental music (like
                                most game OSTs).
