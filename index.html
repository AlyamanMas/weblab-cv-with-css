             Due to the inability to use CSS or JavaScript, this website isn't
             very responsive. It has been tested/designed on a 768x1366 display
             (you can emulate screen size in web dev tools in your web browser)
             on Brave browser (built on chromium) and on Linux. The website also
             makes use of and was designed with the Open Sans font, so it looks
             a lot better with it installed. You can install it from here:
             `https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans` (install all
             weights). (Included in the directory is ./res/Alyaman Maasarani's CV.pdf, showcasing how
             the webpage looks on my PC, (size inaccurate)).

                        A passionate computer science student studying at the BAU with a
                        scholarship. I have loved computers and messing with them since I
                        was a child; this lead me to choosing computer science as my major.
                        I'm mostly interested in A.I., Linux, Rust, and operating systems.
