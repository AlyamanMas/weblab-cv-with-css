                            My love for tinkering with Linux started when I first installed
                            it back in 2016. The degree to which it can be tweaked and
                            changed has awakened my love for computing and programming. I
                            currently use <a href="https://nixos.org/" target=
                            "_blank">NixOS</a> with <a href="https://swaywm.org/" target=
                            "_blank">SwayWM</a>. here are my <a href=

                        <dt>Gaming</dt>
                        <dd>I used to play much more before but my laptop is digging its
                        grave right now. So I mostly play mobile games like Genshin Impact
                        or simple indie games like Alto's Adventure</dd>

                        <dt>Watching Anime/Reading Manga</dt>
                        <dd>
                            I used to spend a lot of time consuming Japanese
                            art/literature, and while I don't have as much time as I
                            did for that anymore, it's still one of my favorite things to
                            do. My favorite Anime are:
                            <ul type="circle">
                                <li>Steins;Gate</li>
                                <li>Ansatsu Kyoushitsu/Assassination Classroom</li>
                                <li>Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso/Your Lie in April</li>
                                <li>No Game No Life</li>

                        <dt>Listening to Podcasts</dt>
                        <dd>
                            I only started listening to podcasts a couple of years ago,
                            but it has already become one of my favorite things to do!
                            It's a nice thing to do when you just want to close your eyes
                            and listen to something, or when doing something routinical
                            that requires hands like house chores. Some of my favorites are:
                            Trash Taste, The Wan Podcast, and Philosophize This
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Music</dt>
                        <dd>
                            I mostly listen either to Japanese music (usually but not
                            necessarily from Anime) or purely instrumental music (like
                            most game OSTs).
                        </dd>
