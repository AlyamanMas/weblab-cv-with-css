            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli,_Lebanon#History">From Wikipedia:</a><br /><br />
            Evidence of settlement in Tripoli dates back as early as 1400 BCE.
            In the 9th century, the Phoenicians established a trading station
            in Tripoli and later, under Persian rule, the city became the
            center of a confederation of the Phoenician city-states of Sidon,
            Tyre, and Arados Island. Under Hellenistic rule, Tripoli was used
            as a naval shipyard and the city enjoyed a period of autonomy. It
            came under Roman rule around 64 BCE. The 551 Beirut earthquake and
            tsunami destroyed the Byzantine city of Tripoli along with other
            Mediterranean coastal cities.
            <br />
            During Umayyad rule, Tripoli became a commercial and shipbuilding
            center. It achieved semi-independence under Fatimid rule, when it
            developed into a center of learning. The Crusaders laid siege to
            the city at the beginning of the 12th century and were able finally
            to enter it in 1109. This caused extensive destruction, including
            the burning of Tripoli's famous library, Dar al-'Ilm (House of
            Knowledge), with its thousands of volumes. During the Crusaders'
            rule the city became the capital of the County of Tripoli. In 1289,
            it fell to the Mamluks and the old port part of the city was
            destroyed. A new inland city was then built near the old castle.
            During Ottoman rule from 1516 to 1918, it retained its prosperity
            and commercial importance. Tripoli and all of Lebanon was under
            French mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved
            independence.
